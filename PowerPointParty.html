        <h2>When?</h2>
        <p> Friday May 20 at 7:30pm PST until like whenever</p>
        <h2>Where?</h2>
        <p>At Nina's apartment -- text her 4802859998 if you don't have the address!</p>
		<h2>What?</h2>    
        <p>A powerpoint party is where you show up to hang out, socialize, and PRESENT! You have 2 options! You can either make a powerpoint about anything you want (preferably something sorta fun but at the very least interesting)! OR you can take a risk and decide to present from a random deck from Nina's stash. Said stash includes powerpoints ranging from category theory, white people salads, and the history of health insurance. BUT YOU MUST PRESENT SOMETHING BECAUSE NINA IS MEAN</p>

        <h2>Why?</h2>    
        <p>Because it's a fun thing to do and have a space to learn something new and hang out with people. And I don't like it when people tell me the rules of board games.</p>
        <p>Use it as an opportunity to talk about a passion of yours, a conspiracy theory you sort of believe, your favorite movie or sport, a hot take, or more! It can be fun, spicy, or radicalizing! The floor is yours!</p>

        <h2>What do I bring?</h2>    
        <p>Please nothing except slides (either via email them to me ninalutz2015@gmail.com)!</p> 
        <p>I have control issues and only so much fridge space. I will have snacks for all dietary restrictions, alcohol, and non alcoholic options. If you really get anxious and need to bring *something* then just bring something from my <a href = "https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/R6UY9S7TV62W?ref_=wl_share">entertaining wishlist on Amazon</a> or something from <a href = "entertainglist.html">my entertainment standards list</a>. Or you can like Venmo me the money you would have spent panic buying something at Bartel's (@nlutz).</p>
        <h2>Ok, I'm sold. This could be fun.</h2>
        <p>Great please please  <a href = "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdwkVm_ot9P___tMs382wcJc5wpJQR7BsYwANAQg4hlivs8IQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">fill out this Google form so I have enough stuff!</a> Thanks!</p>
