        <h2>When?</h2>
        <p> Saturday January 29 at 7pm PST until like whenever</p>
        <h2>Where?</h2>
        <p>At Nina's apartment -- text her 4802859998 if you don't have the address!</p>
		<h2>What?</h2>    
        <p>The hardest part of rosé is that it honestly doesn't go with a lot of cheeses. However, the delicate, fruity, floral, and acidic varietals go perfectly with a select few and Persian style meze. So there will be wine, there will be cheese, there will be meze. Menu is <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/15fn28aFMjISNIXdHWuJykPqrCPwVR-3Cy-2cknr3o6Y/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> if you are concerned. Let me know if you have restrictions or allergies.</p>

        <p> There will be good company. There will be a puzzle on my desk if you need to be anti social. Maybe we'll all play a game. Maybe we'll watch a movie. The possibilities are endless!</p>

        <h2>Why?</h2>    
        <p>Only lame people think that red wine is the only winter option! I am going to prove that no, this is false! Also I uh. Have a lot of wine and I need to not drink it all alone.</p>
       
        <h2>What do I bring?</h2>    
        <p>Please nothing! I have control issues and only so much fridge space. If you really get anxious and need to bring *something* then just bring something from my <a href = "https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/R6UY9S7TV62W?ref_=wl_share">entertaining wishlist on Amazon</a> or something from <a href = "entertainglist.html">my entertainment standards list</a>. Or you can like Venmo me the money you would have spent panic buying something at Bartel's (@nlutz).</p>
        <h2>Ok, I'm sold</h2>
        <p>Great please please  <a href = "https://forms.gle/BdXYnX8UzEAY6C4m8">fill out this Google form so I have enough stuff!</a> Thanks!</p>   

        <h2>But...COVID?</h2>
        <p>So totally ok if you aren't comfy going to a thing right now cuz COVID! I am personally still navigating my risk tolerance and obviously if you are symptomatic -- don't come. Or if you test positive. And if the situation changes and we find out vaccines don't hold up -- don't come near my apartment lol. I will be quaranting like you don't even KNOW.</p>

        <p>In terms of my current risk tolerance/plan for this event: it'll be a group of 9 people if everyone comes and everyone is fully vaxed and boosted (or in the process of getting boosted as I write this). Currently, everyone I know is: being masked in shopping, etc situations and only going unmasked around other vaccinated people or in places with vaccine requirements.</p>   

        <p>Happy to chat with folks who like me are struggling with what is and isn't good risk tolerance -- I think we're all learning together and trying our best for ourselves and communities and there are no clear answers so yea <3 </p>

        <p>But again totally ok if you don't come I will not be offended :P I will have future events.</p>
