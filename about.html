        <p>I am an interdisciplinary researcher who uses computational and artistic methods to explore visual communication and culture at scale. Many computer scientists want to make computers think more like people -- I want to use computers to make us think about other people. I especially focus my work on individuals and groups who are not represented in the making, regulating, and evaluation of visual technologies, data, and communities that affect them.</p>

        <p>I completed my undergraduate education at MIT (with a brief stint at Apple) in Computer Science and Design, and continued on to my MS at the MIT Media Lab. As an undergrad, I developed my research passion and fundamentals under <a href = "https://ira.mit.edu">Ira Winder</a>, deploying computational interactive simulations for urban and corporate entities. I also spent time in the classroom as a TA and instructor during my undergrad years.</p>

        <p>My MS focused on the intersection of art, identity, and technology. My thesis was a sign language edition of a digital participatory artwork called A Counting, featured in multiple museums and the <a href = "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/25/arts/design/a-counting.html">NY Times</a>. I was also a guest for a unit on creative coding at Gallaudet University and I taught a seminar at MIT with Dr. Katlyn Turner on our framework, <a href = "https://ninalutz.github.io/DeCenter/index.html">DeCentering</a>.</p>

		<p>My initial thesis work, canceled by COVID-19, was focused on immersive physical experiences around cultural and gender identities â€“ I get to present some of this work this September at the <a href = "https://paseoproject.org">2022 Paseo Festival</a> in Taos, NM (adapted in a post-COVID world).</p>

        <p>After graduating in 2021 with my MS, I moved to the enchanting Pacific Northwest, where I now call Seattle home. I am a Product Manager at Redfin, where my day to day ranges from development meetings to user research to analytics. I still make <a href = "https://twitter.com/ninasketches">art on the side</a>, and you can find me laser cutting at <a href = "https://seattlemakers.org">Seattle Makers</a>, decorating my apartment, or hosting events with friends.</p>
