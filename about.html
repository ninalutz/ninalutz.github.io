        <p>I am an interdisciplinary researcher who uses computational and artistic methods to explore visual communication and culture at scale. Many computer scientists want to make computers think more like people -- I want to use computers to make us to think about other people. Especially people who are not represented in the making, regulating, and evaluation of the technologies and digital communities that affect them.</p>

        <p>I went to MIT and got a BS and MS in Computer Science, Design, and Media Arts and Sciences (respectively). I spent those 6 years at the MIT Media Lab (with a brief stint away at Apple). For 4 years, as an undergrad, I grew my research foundation in the City Science Group under <a href = "https://ira.mit.edu">Ira Winder</a>, deploying computational interactive simulations for urban and corporate entities. I also spent time in the classroom as a TA and instructor during my undergrad years.</p>

        <p>I spent 2 years doing my MS focusing on identity affirming interactive experiences, which ended in a sign language edition of a digital participatory artwork called A Counting, featured in multiple museums and the <a href = "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/25/arts/design/a-counting.html">NY Times</a>. I was also a guest for a unit on creative coding at Gallaudet University and I taught a seminar at MIT with Dr. Katlyn Turner on our framework, <a href = "https://ninalutz.github.io/DeCenter/index.html">DeCentering</a>.</p>
        

		<p>My initial thesis work, canceled by COVID-19, was focused on immersive and interactive tools and experiences around cultural and gender identities with different communities. I get to present some of this work this September at the <a href = "https://paseoproject.org">2022 Paseo Festival</a> in Taos, NM.</p>

        <p>After graduating in summer 2021 with my MS, I moved from chilly New England to the enchanting emerald Pacific Northwest, where I now call Seattle home. I have been a Product Manager at Redfin in Seattle, WA -- where my day to day ranges from development meetings to user research to analytics. I still make art on the side, and you can find me laser cutting at Seattle Makers, decorating my apartment, or hosting events.</p>
