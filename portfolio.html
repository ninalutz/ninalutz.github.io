													Research

													<ul>
														<span> I am a researcher at the MIT Media Lab Changing Places Group, where I work with the CityScope development team
															to make beautiful and meaningful data visualizations and simulations. <br>While most of the work is software, every simulation
															is integrated with a tangible user interface made of Legos that uses computer vision and inductive circuits to allow users to make interventions
															and see real time changes.

																			<li>
																					<span> Working on agent based models to simulate a compelex system of tourists moving through a city.
																						Developing algorithms to make this visualization more accurate, with special focus on path finding,
																						coordinate transforms, and trip decisions.</span>

																					<span> Exploring different ways to transform geospatial data between different coordinate systems.
																					Rasterizing geospatial data to a Lego coordinate system for fine grained pedestrian movement and

																				<span> This the project I'm leading!
																					Transforming, rendering, and standardizing geospatial data across different coordinate systems.
																					Users can select anywhere in the world and export filtered geojsons of the information they need. And
																					perform modeling simulations within the platform. <br>
																				Exploring math models for pedestrian accessibility in different areas based off demographic and path decisions.
																				i.e; How walkable is Boston at night for a woman vs. a man? What about someone in a wheel chair?<br>
																				This project started in late August and will probably wrap up in December. You can see <a href = "https://changingplaces.github.io/GeoBits/">
																					more documentation online </a>.

														<span> I started working with this local company my sophomore year of high school. I started with web and data development
															and now I'm exploring the world of iOS development and computer vision. </span>
													<li>
															Website and SEO
															<ul>
																	<li>
																			<span> Designed and developed website. This included design, code, and different
																				JavaScript filters for customers to shop for radio control parts by vehicle.
																			Optimized product listings for SEO on Amazon and different third party retailers. </span>

																			<span> I'm currently doing a lot of fun experimenting with computer vision, particularly with part identification.
																			We know what a part looks like from its 3D model, so it's not hard to see when its broken. This is easy with one part,
																		but a little harder when looking a variety of parts in a region on a radio control car. <br>
																			Using the SIFT algorithm and some hand cooked algorithms and machine learning implementations I'm developing an iOS app
																			that allows the user to take a photo of the region of the car that's giving them issues, identifies broken parts,
																			 and lets the user purchase a replacement. <br>
																			 This is a project I've been having a lot of fun with and I'm set to finish and
																			 pitch my application during IAP (MIT's January break) 2017.
