							<h1>Andorra</h1>
							<p> Working with the country of Andorra, my lab sought to understand how people move through Andorra, especially
							during events.</p>
							<p> I worked with my supervisor <a href = "http://jamesira.com">Ira Winder</a> on an agent based model that reflected how tourists moved through the
								capitol of Andorra based on CDR (call detail record) data. </p>
								<p> My main responsibility was developing an algorithm to distribute the tourists at different amenities based
								on their rough location and language. This was a modified version of a voronoi algorithm.</p>
								<p> This was a great introduction to research for me, as I was a freshman during the project,
									and resulted in a<a href = "https://www.bbhub.io/company/sites/2/2016/09/paper_57.pdf"> paper </a>that was accepted
									to Bloomberg's Data for Good Exchange.</p>
								<p><a href = "http://cp.media.mit.edu/andorra-model/">This</a> was the video and write up for some of the work.
									And this is an official<a href = "http://cp.media.mit.edu/blog/agents"> update</a> on the general approach my
									lab uses for these models, and it also explains how we apply urban planning, math modeling, graph theory, and
									agent based simulation to this and other projects.</p>
								<p> The following is a brief synopsis and some animations of the model.</p>
								<p> Here is the final simulation, including the UI showing more information about the population of tourists.</p>
									<p></p>

								<p></p>
								<p> This was the derived origin destination matrix and agent based model for the area. This basically shows where people are going
									based on CDR data, from cell phone tower hand offs. This model and agent based implementation was done by my supervisor Ira Winder. </p>
										<p></p>
										<center> <img align="middle" src="images/agentsandorra.gif" style="width:70%;"></center>
											<p></p>
								<p> This is the simulation with my algorithm (because people don't move directly from and to cell towers)
									after I implemented a modified Voronoi algorithm.</p>
									<p></p>
										<center> <img align="middle" src="images/voronoi.gif" style="width:70%;"></center>
											<p></p>
									Note the different amenities all have different categories (restaurants, shopping, etc), languages,
									capacities, and prices associated with them. The goal of the voronoi algorithm
									is to assign amenities to their respective cell towers and assign segments of the population to the individual amenities.</p>
