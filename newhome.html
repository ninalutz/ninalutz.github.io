            <h2>Hello, I’m Nina Lutz.</h2>
            <p>I am an interdisciplinary researcher who uses computational and artistic methods to explore visual communication and culture at scale. I often call this being a glittery computer scientist. I have an ecletic set of training in computer science, mathematics, optics, architecture, design, urban planning, bar tending, endocrinology, skin care, art, and more. I would call myself a jack of all trades, but with some spikes.</p>

            <p>I am currently a graduate student working on my MS at the MIT Media Lab under Ekene Ijeoma, Zach Lieberman, and Caroline Jones. My current thesis is a sign language edition of a digital participatory artwork called A Counting, which I was also a developer on. I went to undergrad at MIT and studied Computer Science and Design and hung out at the Media Lab, Apple, and the Department of Architecture and Urban Planning a lot.</p>

            <p>My past thesis work, canceled by COVID-19, was focused on immersive and interactive tools and experiences around Latine and gender identities. I would love to pick up some of this work when it is safe to have big makeup classes and public events again.</p>

            <p>I’m actively looking for my next adventure after I graduate in Summer 2021, so please hire me to do either creative technology or data things for you.</p>

            <p>I am also actively seeking and open to lecturer, adjunct, technical instructor, programming coordinator, and other academic jobs. I am passionate about fostering a love of research, art, and engineering in diverse undergraduate populations.</p>
