        <h2>When?</h2>
        <p>November 20th at 7pm PST until like whenever</p>
        <h2>Where?</h2>
        <p>At Nina's apartment -- text her if you don't have the address! The apartment is still decorated as fall -- sorry folks.</p>
		<h2>What?</h2>    
        <p>There will be wine, there will be cheese, there will be other snacks. Menu is <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OXysZGnrzh4CwSA4yRBA-pbCf7geUxUn3J7QPOO5B0s/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> if you are concerned. No one invited is vegan, but let me know if you have restrictions. There will be good company. There will be a puzzle on my desk if you need to be anti social. Maybe we'll all play a game. Maybe we'll put on a holiday thing on the TV. The possibilities are endless!</p>
        <h2>Why?</h2>    
        <p>Only lame people think that red wine is the only winter option! I am going to prove that no, white wine is a perfect wintery to late fall treat! Also I uh. Have a lot of white wine and I need to not drink it all alone but also it is realistically not going to last until summer.</p>
        <h2>What do I bring?</h2>    
        <p>Please nothing! I have control issues and only so much fridge space. If you really get anxious and need to bring *something* then just bring something from my <a href = "https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/R6UY9S7TV62W?ref_=wl_share">entertaining wishlist on Amazon</a> or something from <a href = "entertainglist.html">my entertainment standards list</a>. Or you can like Venmo me the money you would have spent panic buying something at Bartel's (@nlutz).</p>
        <h2>Ok, I can go</h2>
        <p>Great <a href = "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfBygySrKIlIdXVmV2MKaNiOzJLfys6vwGW7BMYc8oVIrdaKg/viewform?usp=sf_link">fill out this Google form</a> if you have a car that you intend to drive and park here elsewise you can do the form with no car or text me 4802859998. Thanks!</p>
