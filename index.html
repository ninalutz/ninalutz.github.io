            <p>Hi, I'm Nina Lutz. I'm a graduate student at the MIT Media Lab. I'm redoing my website soon. Please use <a href = "https://media.mit.edu/people/nlutz"> my lab page</a> in the mean time, it doesn't have all of my work, but it has a lot of current work.</p> 
			
  
           	<p>Also feel free to <a href = "mailto:nlutz@media.mit.edu">email me</a> for a CV or projects or something. I am on Twitter and Instagram as ninalikespi if you want to find me there. I am not actively looking for anything but am always happy to have interesting conversations.</p>
