            <h4 class="ml-1">I am a social computing and HCI researcher who focuses on participatory visual culture as it intersects with questions of information disorder/problematic information (misinformation, scams, propaganda, online hate, etc) and digital safety. I have led empirical work on this within the contexts of religion, elections, and immigration.</h4> 

        	<h4>I hope by examining these interactions to find opportunities for making sociotechnical systems safer and more dignified for everyone and open additional pathways to participation, literacy, and accountability within them. This often leads me to focus on methods for researchers and practioners to safely and rigorously conduct digital visual research.</h4>

            <h4>I am a third year PhD student at the <a href = "https://www.hcde.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a> in the <a href = "https://www.cip.uw.edu/">Centered for an Informed Public</a>, advised by Dr. Kate Starbird.</h4>
            
            <h4>I have also interned at Microsoft Research, leading work at the intersection of <a href = "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/technology-for-religious-empowerment/">religion</a>, technology, and digital safety under Dr. E. Glen Weyl.</h4>

            <h4>On the side, I am a founding partner in my colleague Dr. Katlyn Turner's research consultancy, KTLN, where I lend my computational and information disorder expertise to challenges in the environmental justice space.</h4>
