<h1>Nina Lutz</h1>

<p>If you were looking for Nina Lutz's web page, you're in the right place. Sort of. I'm Nina Lutz, you can email me at nlutz@mit.edu. I'm an incoming graduate student at the MIT Media Lab starting full time in Feburary 2019 and I need to put together a new and more cohesive portfolio when I have time (probably this upcoming winter holiday). Until then you can see my Media Lab affiliated work and read more about me <a href = "https://www.media.mit.edu/people/nlutz/overview/">here</a>. Thanks! </p>
